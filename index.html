          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>
            Well Hello, my name Is Charles Bateson and some of you may well know
            me as just another Bartender, quenching the thirst of many Sydney
            musicians, but what you may not know is im also a qualified Personal
            Trainer and Massage Therapist and have worked for companies such as
            The Sheraton Hotel, Vision Personal Training Studios & Premier
            Health and Fitness. I have juggled the mixed lifestyle of health and
            fitness and the dark corners of late night entertainment and can see
            how the cross over for many can be too daunting or not viable in the
            conventional sense. And thats what im here to help with. To dedicate
            what i have learnt and offer the many musicians who have given their
            lives to pleasing the masses a chance to give back to themselves in
            one simple class.
          </p>
          <h2>What To Expect</h2>
