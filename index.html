					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<p>
						Well Hello, my name Is Charles Bateson and some of you may well know
						me as just another Bartender, quenching the thirst of many Sydney
						musicians, but what you may not know is im also a qualified Personal
						Trainer and Massage Therapist and have worked for companies such as
						The Sheraton Hotel, Vision Personal Training Studios & Premier
						Health and Fitness. I have juggled the mixed lifestyle of health and
						fitness and the dark corners of late night entertainment and can see
						how the cross over for many can be too daunting or not viable in the
						conventional sense. And thats what im here to help with. To dedicate
						what i have learnt and offer the many musicians who have given their
						lives to pleasing the masses a chance to give back to themselves in
						one simple class.
					</p>
					<h2>What To Expect</h2>
					<p>
						A fun and easy way to exercise without having to change your life.
						The Classes are Time base so you go at your own pace, The Class
						instructors, encourage and motivate you to make sure everyone is
						benefiting and getting the most out of the class. They personally
						demonstrate and assist you in doing the exercises correctly.
					</p>
					<h2>What To Bring</h2>
					<p>
						A towel or yoga mat to do exercises on. Relevant clothing. A sweat
						rag, and a big cheesy smile, knowing every class is an active step
						to a healthier body
